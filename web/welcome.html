            <p>I used to be welcoming, but I’ll tell you something: I would only be that way in the late evening.<br> 
                Oh, occasionally the early evening, but usually the late evening – or the mid-evening. <br>
                Just the early evening, midevening and late evening. Occasionally, early afternoon, early midafternoon, <br>
                or perhaps the late-midafternoon. Oh, sometimes the early-mid-late-early morning. . .  But never at dusk.</p>
